Title: Math Classes
Description: We have been working on a new set of foundational interfaces for formalized constructive mathematics in Coq, heavily based on Coq's new type classes, used in a systematic way in order to achieve:
* elegant and mathematically sound abstract interfaces for algebraic and numeric structures up to and including rationals (with practical use of universal algebra and category theory);
* a very flexible purely predicate-based representation of algebraic structures that makes sharing, multiple inheritance, and derived inheritance, all trivial;
* clean expression terms that neither refer to proofs nor require deeply nested record projections;
* fluent rewriting;
* easy and flexible replacement and specialization of data representations and operations with more efficient versions;
* ordinary mathematical notation and overloaded names not reliant on Coq's notation scopes.
Keywords: type classes
